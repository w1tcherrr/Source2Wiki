Multiple scripted sequences of the same name (or sync group, if specified) will frame-synchronize in the action animation once all the actors have moved to position. This allows tight interaction between actors (one actor grabbing another, hitting them, etc.) The flow is as follows:\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E1) Move to position using the specified movement animation. If \u0027Move to Position\u0027 is set to NONE, skip to step 2.\u003Cbr/\u003E2) If forced to wait for another actor to move to position, play the pre-action idle animation, otherwise skip to step 3. If there is no pre-action idle specified, ACT_IDLE is used.\u003Cbr/\u003E3) Fire the OnBeginSequence output.\u003Cbr/\u003E4) Play the action animation. If no action animation is specified, skip to step 5.\u003Cbr/\u003E5) Play the post-action idle animation. If none is specified, skip to step 6. If the \u0027Loop in Post Idle\u0027 spawnflag is set, keep playing the post-action idle until the script is cancelled. If no post-action idle animation is specified, ACT_IDLE is used.\u003Cbr/\u003E6) Fire the OnEndSequence output.\u003Cbr/\u003E7) If a next script to play is specified, hand the NPC to the next script and repeat this process for that script.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe MoveToPosition input runs steps 1 and 2, then waits while playing the pre-action idle animation until the BeginSequence input is received.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EIf the sequence has motion extraction in it, set the \u0027Don\u0027t Teleport NPC On End\u0027 spawnflag.",
